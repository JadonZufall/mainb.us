# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is not meant to be deployed in other places besides the offical mainb.us domain, therefore no versions of this software are offically supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Create an issue if it is not a big deal, otherwise use the github private report feature or email me at jadonzufall@gmail.com.
